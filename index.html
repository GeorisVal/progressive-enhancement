            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
            </p>
            <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            <p>The farmer said,</p> 
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> 
            <p>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            </p>
            <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            <p>The farmer again said,</p>
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> 
            </p>

            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
            </p>
            <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q>
            <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> 
            <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
            </p>
            <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> 
            <p>Again, he said, </p>
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.
